Algolia is one of those heroes of the AI space that I rarely hear about in the daily AI news, but they are powering thousands of websites on the web, many of them open source, giving them Google-like search intelligence and more.

You can read more about the technology and especially the analytics features here

and Algolia for Netlify

But did you know that you can use the same technology not only for large websites, but also for a small blog or Webshop?


In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the simple process of integrating Algolia search into your Netlify-hosted Next.js blog.

Let’s go.

Prerequisites
A blog using the nextjs-blog-theme template
A Netlify account
Basic knowledge of Next.js
Step 1: Set Up Your Blog
First, clone and deploy the blog template:

Step 2: Install Algolia Crawler

Visit Algolia Crawler for Netlify
Click "Sign in to Algolia with Netlify"
Authorize the Algolia crawler application
Search for your site and click "Install"
Confirm by clicking "Install plugin"
Copy the snippet above. We'll use it later to add Algolia to our blog.

I If everything is set up correctly, you should now be able to see the index and the records for your blog posts.
